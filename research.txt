Sara:
For the skin care app there is this website (http://www.healthcentral.com/skin-care/c/1443/161252/10-skin-care-apps/)
that introduces 10 apps for skin care. Among these ten there was one that was close to
shannon's idea:
Love my Skin:

"An app to promote awareness of skin cancer. You can “tap” on a section of the body 
to highlight any moles you want to watch in the future.
 You can enter descriptions and details and then update each time
 you do a skin self-check, tracking any changes.
 Available for iPad and iPhone. Free"

Although the idea seems really close it didn't mention anywhere that the app itself
can actually do image processing.
There is also another app which is for iphone too named Skin Tracker that 
I think is exactly what we wanted to make. Here is the link for that:
https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/skin-tracker/id497322842?mt=8
and this was its description:

"Analyse your skin disease by tracking your daily food, medicine, stress-level and feeling. Take photos of the affected 
areas of your skin and track its development towards total healing. Also see the progress of the disease and the healing 
process in a graphical analysis. Export the data and take it with you to medical consultations. This app supports you to 
analyse possible reasons for your skin disease. It is a helpful tracker in case of a dietary change to get your skin cured.
 The app provides a basic food setup of what might be good for you to eat and what kind of food you should rather avoid."

Both of these apps are for iphone though. Other than these there was a Skin Scan and
Skin cancer app which were iphone apps too here is the link:(http://internetmedicine.com/dermatology-apps/).
So maybe we can make an app for android?
I found this app for android: first derm: Dermatology Online but it basically take pictures
and send them anonymously to a doctor and see what to do next.
Of course as the prof said we shouldn't think about the way we are doing it at the first stage but I was just wondering
if making an android app would be considered as a new product?

Nikita:

I think SkinTracker is more of tracker different diseases. Shannon's idea is to track products

The healthcare website  doesn't have any app similiar to  that

Shannon idea  is to track different products for a given disease and rank them accordingly. 

This website has points which we should consider for tracking products 
http://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/skin-care-basics/_/stopping-unwanted-reactions-to-skincare-products

In terms of deliverable
Product:
SkinCare  Product Tracker
Users: 
People switching  between skincare products
Problem solved:
Deciding which product works best for  us by try and testing it once. This app tracks the info so next time we have the problem we already know the solution

Overall the idea is good. There can be more additional features.

In terms of technology. I would be more happy with iOS.
