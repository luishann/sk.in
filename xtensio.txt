The process of creating user personas was very important for us since it helped us focus more our user gorup.
Before creating this personas, we were deciding if we wanted to focus more on dermatologists as our end user
or we wanted to make an app for the people that suffer skin conditions. After creating this artifacts, it 
became clear to us that the problem that normal people have right now is a bigger problem for them and 
we can create a product that solves it.
