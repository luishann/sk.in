# SK.IN/TEAM 15

## Iteration XX - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Oct 25, 2016
 * Where: Skype

## Process - Reflection


Our team agreed that the best way to approach this phase of our project was meeting regularly and keep a flowing communication in order to have a big set of ideas available. In addition, we decided to focus our product in a particular, well-defined user group. After bringing numerous ideas to the table we wanted to focus on a product targeted to people facing skin conditions that help them keep track of their progress. This brainstorming, communication and planning process will be pivotal in the success of our product. Additionally, this stage of the process helped us to know each other and learn how each one of us work and what skills set each member has and learn which job they will be more comfortable taking in further sprints.

*Decisions turned out well:*


- Set a systematic time to meet helped us better communicate our insights to the team and listen to other people’s opinion on a given idea. This way creating all the artifacts was faster and we avoided repetition since we were all on the same page.


- Keep a note-taker for every meeting. This was very important in order to go back and check what was discussed in that meeting and how were responsibilities assigned among each group member. The note-taker was also responsible for creating the Trello tasks and assign them to each person.


- Doing our own research about what are the major challenges that people facing skin conditions have to go through helped us tailor our product to meet the user’s needs. For example, the survey results were extremely insightful for us because they helped us make our product more specific for people who suffer a severe/medical skin condition that requires detailed tracking.


** Decisions did not turn out as well as you hoped: **


- We did not asked for help when we required it. We thought that the process of creating an Android UI was going to be simple enough to finish it in this iteration. However, as one could see in our Trello board, that task has been staged for more than a week there. Since we had to refresh our knowledge in Android and also it depends heavily on all the external dependencies, the process of debugging was lengthy and stopped us from moving forward.


- User research was not as simple as we thought it was going to be. We were expecting hundreds of responses in order to have a significant sample of the population from where we can derive important insights to find the “pain” that our users were experiencing regarding skin-care products. However, survey responses were not as high as we thought and we expected more people willing to take a survey. 


** Changes to be Made: **


- First, we will have our team communications through Slack. We have already set up the team for it and we think that having different channels for different tasks during the development process will make the process easier and faster for the whole team.


- Commit more, commit often. Our repository and Trello board should be constantly and synchronously updated. We should also create a Trello board for each team during the development process. This way we will be able to see if a team/person is stuck at some part of the process and be able to help as quickly as possible. 


- Our systematic  fiveteen minute meetings were enough for this part of the project. However, we will now have stand-up meetings every three days in order to go discuss more about the challenges and proposed solutions for every step of the way.



## Product - Review

** Goals/tasks that were met/completed: **

1) Have our team organization systemized
 - We are using Trello (Scrum artifact) to accomplish this goal
 - On Trello, we will organize a to-do list where each member will be assigned their respective tasks and deadlines 
 - This gives us the flexibility of moving tasks into different cycles as we progress into the development.

2) Research into the skin care products to find uniqueness between our product with the ones established
  - We wanted to see which applications have already implemented our objectives and if so, look into what features they were lacking
  - We analysed the features of applications with objectives similar to ours, and conducted a research on what would enhance the user experience
  - We concluded our research in a Research.txt file

3) Have the rough design of the application sketched
  - We drew rough designs of how the interphase should look like
  - We uploaded mock up images that demonstrate our designs

4) Have a rough idea of how to start Android development
  - We researched into
      -> how to create navigation bars and whether to use navigation bars/hamburger menus or tabs 
      -> how fragments are better than activities, as they are reusable whereas activities need to be created every time. 
  - Links are posted in artifacts that demonstrates our research

5) Have an outline of the application’s functionality
  - Have the functionality outlined for each feature
  - Outline the collaboration and responsibilities of different objects and classes in the application
  - Done through CRC Cards (Uploaded in artifacts)

6) Have an outline of how to organize and store information about Users, Products, Product Reviews, and Skin Issues separately
  - Create Relations between users, their skin issues, the products they use and the reviews they make on the products to help organize the storage of information
  - Data organization is defined through database schemas, posted in artifacts 


** Goals/tasks that were planned but not met/completed: **

 1. Making a small interface in Android 
   - Did not have time to get to the beginnings of coding as the environment is new and requires more research into Android API
 2.	Starting the Server
   - Still have to decide which language to use for the server 
   - We have left this as a goal for the phase 2 planning meeting
 3. Talking to dermatologists about viability of our application
   - If we include dermatologists in our application, this will broaden the scope, 
   - We wanted to restrict the objective to a specific niche of attracting users with skin related concerns so we decided to pivot to another direction, by not involving dermatologists


** Going into the next iteration, our main insights are: **

1) Using the CRC Cards to guide back-end development
  - Since CRC cards outline the functionality of each class in this application, this can help us rank the tasks to see which ones play an important role in developing the foundation for this application.

2) Continue using Trello to keep track of completed work 
  - We will assign tasks regularly on Trello to control the flow of work between the members in the team. 
  - Through this process, the work is balanced between the members and will help meet deadlines.
  
3) Create slack channels for team-based work
 - Organize conversations within each sub team of the assigned tasks
 - We will have slack channels to help discuss every member’s concerns and progress regarding the tasks they are assigned. 

4) Assign rotating scrum masters for future meetings
 - To introduce new perspectives at presenting, managing and completing tasks
 - To give everyone an opportunity to lead and organize the team
