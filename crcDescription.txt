Basically there are six classes that we will need in our back end design. 
First we need to have a User class which is responsible for user's login and profile operations like changing the password and editing the profile, creating or deleting a journal, adding products and listing user's products and issues. The user can also view the history of issues and see which issues were solved or not.
Second, we need a Journal class. A journal contains a list of entries and is responsible for operations that can be done on entries like searching, comparing, adding or deleting an entry or sorting and grouping entries based on a specific issue or product. Other than this, the user can also decorate or customize his/her journal.
Entry is basically a page in the journal. It contains a picture, a description (which can be audio, video or text), the issue that is related to that picture and the product that was used at the time the picture was taken. Based on these properties, an Entry class is responsible for attaching and editing a picture, adding descriptions, tagging an issue or a product and adding a rating for that entry.
The product class is responsible for everything about a specific product. In other words it is responsible for: reviewing the product, rating the product, comparing another product to that specific product, getting feedback and other people's opinions about the product, and viewing the progress of using that product.
The issue class includes the start and end date of that issue and is responsible for adding products that are used for that issue and viewing the progress of it.
The server class basically gets and sends data back and forth between different users and itself and does some operations on the data to give feedback to the user.
