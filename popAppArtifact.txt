We used PopApp as the very first app for rapid prototyping. On my phone, it was not a great experience. The in-app camera was not very good for some reason and pictures came out extremely blurry. Putting together the pictures to demonstrate the app control flow was also not a pleasant experience. The pictures could not be rotated and we could not fully resize it to make it fit our screen. Finally, the transitions from screen to screen supplied were very basic. 
For these reasons, we decided to not proceed any further with the prototyping app. However, it did generate some valuable insights into our next stage of UX prototyping. For one, actually sitting down and drawing the user experience for the app really helped concretize the whole UX deisgn process. We came up with the idea to include an on-camera guide for the user to better capture their face, an idea which our TA also recommended to use later on. The PopApp prototype was an important step, and helped our next iteration--our Invision prototype. As you can see with our Invision prototype, it is much "slicker" and is higher fidelity in terms of the UX experience for a modern app. However, Invision is not for Android at the moment.
