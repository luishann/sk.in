# YOUR PRODUCT/TEAM NAME

Q1: What are you planning to build?
We plan to build a product that makes tracking skin care products and treatments easier for both end-users and dermathologists.
This product is aimed for people who: A) have a severe skin issue that needs treatment from a professional or B) have a 
strong desire to keep track of their usage of a certain skin product. We aim to make this process easier, measurable and 
motivating.We are planning to build a native mobile application together with a web server to make it accessible from any device
that our user would want to have. 
#### Q2: Who are your target users?
 Our product is targetted to two users groups. First, people who suffer from severe skin issues and people who want to track their progress using a given skin care product. Second, 
dermathologists who want to offer the service of constant tracking of their patients. This way the doctor may ask the patient
to switch the product if not progress is being made concerning the issue.This product aims to solve our user's concern
on how certain skin care products/treatments are working for their particular case and keep track of their progress.
