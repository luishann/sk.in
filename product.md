# YOUR PRODUCT/TEAM NAME

Q1: What are you planning to build?
We plan to build a product that makes tracking skin care products and treatments easier for both end-users and dermathologists.
This product is aimed for people who: A) have a severe skin issue that needs treatment from a professional or B) have a 
strong desire to keep track of their usage of a certain skin product. We aim to make this process easier, measurable and 
motivating.We are planning to build a native mobile application together with a web server to make it accessible from any device
that our user would want to have. 
#### Q2: Who are your target users?
 Our product is targetted to two users groups. First, people who suffer from severe skin issues and people who want to track their progress using a given skin care product. Second, 
dermathologists who want to offer the service of constant tracking of their patients. This way the doctor may ask the patient
to switch the product if not progress is being made concerning the issue.This product aims to solve our user's concern
on how certain skin care products/treatments are working for their particular case and keep track of their progress.

#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem?
Currently there is only one mobile app in the market called Skin Tracker that also provides a platform for users to write entries and 
take photos to keep track of their skin progress. However, this app is only available for iOS and costs $6.99. Therefore users who don't 
own an iPhone or don't want to shell out money may choose to use our product. These people not using Skin Tracker has to resort to either
using regular photo albums in their phone, or to use a regular diary/journal app not intended for their purpose. Our app would appeal to
these people because it would be much more organized than using a regular photo album and we'll add useful features for skin tracking
that a regular diary would not have. A dedicated app for this purpose would also motivate people to be more committed in tracking their
skin concerns, as we will have reminders/notifications for those who may be too forgetful to regularly add a new picture to their photo
album.

Another thing that sets us apart from the Skin Tracker app is that Skin Tracker emphasizes on the impact of food, stress, and emotions on 
the healing of skin diseases. Our app on the other hand highlights the use of skincare products and we will have features that allow 
people to see if a product is doing any good or harm. So as much as we are tracking a person's skin, we will also be tracking the 
effectiveness of a user's skincare products/ skincare routine, something that Skin Tracker does not do.
