## Meeting October 3rd 

Secretary: John Chen

+ Sebastian ideas:
When you go to a new doctor, you need to repeat same information a lot
App that helps you keep track of your medical data
We would need to establish a standard
Would also be a good idea for ER 
  - Adam’s response:
Huge idea in scope
--might be better to refine it for specific users and why they would use it
Why are these users going to adopt what we’re designing? USER VALIDATION!
+ Nikita:
class on time app
Personal scheduler/assistant app
Specific group: lazy students
NOT a suggestion app, just really about keeping track of time, taking breaks etc.
We need to make it more 
+ Shannon: skin care app, take pictures of your face everyday and see if it works
Also helps with girls when they switch them and then get pimples keep them get track of

+ John: Randomized local kickstarter idea, where you can only fund projects within a two kilometer radius of where you live

+ Sarah:
copy lots of different stuff from different iteams
copy all highlighted stuff from a doc to another doc

+ Sebastian: topCoder like craigslist for tech jobs
Instead of topCoder, we have a pro-bono/low-cost topCoder for students and charities
freecodecamp, online courses for development

+ John 2: Problem: developers not knowing what to hack/develop
Solution: Emphatically NOT Tinder! 
But location based app, we vet the users by a competitive application process etc.

For next meeting: everyone pick an idea they like and do some research on it. We will conduct the vote next time!
